## v7.0 Forge Integration — ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-17)

**All 5 phases (78–82) complete + verified live.** Forge folded into CodePulse via the Surface-Substrate bridge (state UP via httpActions, commands DOWN via a Convex queue). Full archive + stats: [milestones/v7.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v7.0-ROADMAP.md) · requirements: [milestones/v7.0-REQUIREMENTS.md](milestones/v7.0-REQUIREMENTS.md).

<details>
<summary>v7.0 phase detail (archived 2026-06-17)</summary>

**Milestone goal:** Make Forge a first-class CodePulse module so all coding-agent work happens in one application — without moving Forge's execution engine off the local machine.

**Core constraint:** Forge's engine must stay LOCAL (spawns local CLIs, manages local processes, reads local workspace files/artifacts, tails local logs — Convex cloud cannot). So this is a **cloud-frontend ↔ local-backend bridge** via the Surface-Substrate pattern: Forge runs as a local daemon emitting state UP via an `/ingest`-style httpAction (same role Ástríðr plays), and CodePulse sends commands DOWN via a Convex command queue the daemon polls. Clerk-gated. **Rejected:** a cloud tab calling `http://localhost` directly (mixed-content blocked).

Phases are sequenced so each ships independently and the riskiest unknown (live-log streaming) is isolated late.

### Phase 78: Forge Emitter + Convex Schema

**Status**: ✅ SHIPPED (read-only foundation)
**Goal**: A local Forge daemon emits job/workspace state UP to Convex; CodePulse stores and can query it. No UI, commands, or logs yet.
**Requirements**: FI-01 (forge schema), FI-02 (emitter + `/forge-ingest`), FI-03 (read query API)
**Depends on**: Forge Phase 5 (shipped)
**Cross-repo**: paired with Forge's own roadmap Phase 6 "Event Emitter" (emitter half lands in the `forge` repo)
**Artifacts**: `phases/078-forge-emitter-convex-schema/` (CONTEXT + PLAN + SUMMARY)

### Phase 79: Forge UI Tab (read-only render)

**Status**: ✅ SHIPPED (PR #20)
**Goal**: A `/forge` route + nav entry rendering jobs/status/detail from `useQuery(api.forge.*)`, porting StatusBadge/JobList/JobDetail ~1:1 from `forge/web/src`. View-only.
**Requirements**: FI-04 (forge page + route), FI-05 (component port)
**Depends on**: Phase 78
**Plans**: 3/3 complete (3 waves) — see `phases/79-forge-ui-tab-read-only-render/`

### Phase 80: Command Bridge (launch + stop)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (4/4 plans, 3 waves) — verified live 2026-06-16 (bridge launch + stop round-trip)
**Goal**: A Convex `forgeCommands` queue the daemon long-polls; launch/stop → command → daemon executes → status reflects back. Port NewJobModal. Clerk-gated mutations.
**Requirements**: FI-06 (command queue + daemon poll), FI-07 (launch/stop UI), FI-08 (auth gating)
**Depends on**: Phase 79 (shipped)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. An enqueued launch/stop command in `forgeCommands` is delivered to the daemon exactly once via long-poll, and its execution status reflects back into `forgeJobs`
  2. Operator launches a new Forge job (ported NewJobModal) and stops a running job from `/forge`, round-tripping through the queue
  3. Command-issuing mutations are Clerk-gated — no unauthenticated write path to launch/stop

**Plans**: 4 plans (2 waves)

  - [x] 80-01-PLAN.md — Convex backend: forgeCommands/forgeHosts schema, Clerk fail-closed enqueue mutations, daemon claim/ack httpActions, TTL cron, tests (FI-06, FI-08)
  - [x] 80-02-PLAN.md — Cross-repo Forge daemon CommandPoller: poll → claim → execute (launch/stop) → ack; reflect-back via existing emitter (FI-06)
  - [x] 80-03-PLAN.md — Launch UI: useForge hooks, ForgeStatusBadge variants, trimmed ForgeLaunchModal + host picker, Clerk-gated Launch button + optimistic pending rows (FI-07, FI-08)
  - [x] 80-04-PLAN.md — Stop UI: ForgeStopConfirmDialog (work-discard warning) + ForgeJobDetail Stop wiring with honest Stopping… async (FI-07, FI-08)

### Phase 81: Live Log Streaming

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (4/4 plans, 3 waves) — verified live 2026-06-17 (Forge→CodePulse log round-trip; closes Forge 08-HUMAN-UAT). VERIFICATION: passed (4/4 criteria).
**Goal**: Stream live job logs into the read-only Forge UI tab. **Design locked in `phases/081-live-log-streaming/081-SPEC.md` (2026-06-15)** — supersedes the original "HIGH-risk direct daemon→browser SSE/WebSocket spike." Logs flow Forge → `POST /forge-log-ingest` → append-only `forgeLogChunks` table → reactive `forge.listJobLogs` query; **Convex reactivity IS the live stream** (no SSE/WS to build). Risk dropped from HIGH to LOW.
**Requirements**: FI-09 (log-ingest endpoint + append-only `forgeLogChunks` + `seq` idempotency), FI-10 (LogViewer renders live tail via reactive `listJobLogs`), FI-11 (retention: 7-day TTL cron + per-job byte cap)
**Depends on**: Phase 80
**Locked decisions** (from 081-SPEC):

  - **D-1**: monotonic per-job `seq` (required on envelope) → deterministic ordering + idempotent re-delivery
  - **D-2**: 7-day TTL cron **+** per-job byte/chunk cap (drop-oldest) — a deliverable with a test, not deferred (~1 MB/job suggested)
  - **D-3**: reuse `FORGE_INGEST_API_KEY` (separate `FORGE_LOG_INGEST_URL` gate, shared key)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `POST /forge-log-ingest` with `{type:"log", hostId, forgeJobId, lines, seq}` + valid bearer appends a chunk; repeat `(hostId,forgeJobId,seq)` is a no-op; bad body → 400; bad bearer → 401; OPTIONS → CORS
  2. `forge.listJobLogs({hostId, forgeJobId})` returns chunks ordered by `seq`; the Forge UI tab renders them and updates live as chunks arrive
  3. A scheduled sweep enforces the 7-day TTL AND per-job byte cap — verified by a cron/cleanup test
  4. **Cross-repo handoff** (Forge side, ~1 task): `makeLogSink` no-op → real `fetch` to `/forge-log-ingest`; set `FORGE_LOG_INGEST_URL`; live round-trip closes Forge `08-HUMAN-UAT.md`

**Plans**: 4 plans (3 waves)

  - [x] 81-01-PLAN.md — Receiver: forgeLogChunks schema + /forge-log-ingest httpAction + appendLogChunk (seq-idempotent) + listJobLogs + contract test (FI-09)
  - [x] 81-02-PLAN.md — Retention: sweepForgeLogChunks (7-day TTL + per-job ~1 MB cap, drop-oldest) + daily cron + cleanup test (FI-11)
  - [x] 81-03-PLAN.md — UI: useForgeJobLogs hook + ForgeLogPane (auto-follow tail / pause / jump-to-latest) behind a Details/Logs tab in ForgeJobDetail (FI-10)
  - [x] 81-04-PLAN.md — Cross-repo: finalize Forge makeLogSink (real fetch + seq, T-6-KEYLEAK) + live round-trip, closes Forge 08-HUMAN-UAT (FI-09/10/11)

### Phase 82: Files + Artifact Preview + Hardening

**Status**: 📋 ACTIVE
**Goal**: Browse a terminal job's workspace files and preview text/code/HTML + image artifacts in the cloud `/forge` UI, with metadata + capped bytes flowing daemon → Convex → cloud (the Surface-Substrate bridge used for logs in Phase 81 — NOT a tunnel/local-https/localhost path); plus end-to-end auth correctness, OPS-01 production CORS + deploy checklist, and empty/loading/error polish.
**Requirements**: FI-12 (files/preview), FI-13 (artifact reachability), FI-14 (hardening)
**Depends on**: Phase 81
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Operator browses a job's workspace files and previews artifacts in `/forge` (ported FileBrowser / ArtifactPreview)
  2. Artifact/file content is reachable from the cloud UI via the Convex bounded-ingest bridge (no mixed-content `http://localhost`; tunnel/local-https rejected per 82-SPEC)
  3. End-to-end auth gating across the Forge surface; the full launch→run→logs→artifacts path is auth-correct and production-ready

**Plans**: 4 plans

  - [x] 82-01-PLAN.md — Convex receiver: forgeFiles/forgeArtifacts tables, bearer-authed /forge-file-ingest, listJobFiles/getJobArtifact queries
  - [x] 82-02-PLAN.md — Retention sweep (TTL + per-job cap, blob-before-row) + daily cron + OPS-01 deploy checklist
  - [x] 82-03-PLAN.md — UI port: useForgeJobFiles hooks, FileBrowser + ArtifactPreview (sandboxed), ForgeFilesPane + Files tab
  - [x] 82-04-PLAN.md — Cross-repo forge daemon: workspace enumeration + emitFiles + live round-trip (forge repo) — listing bridge verified live (forge fix a31dca4); preview-bytes codex-sandbox ACL block **fixed in forge `dbfad91`** (icacls grant on promoteWorkspace) — **live end-to-end preview round-trip still pending operator verification** (per 82-04-SUMMARY § CHECKPOINT)

## Execution Order

```
Phase 78 (Emitter + Schema)        ✅ SHIPPED
        │
Phase 79 (UI Tab, read-only)       ✅ SHIPPED (PR #20)
        │
Phase 80 (Command Bridge)          ◀── NEXT — launch/stop queue + Clerk gating
        │
Phase 81 (Live Log Streaming)      design LOCKED (081-SPEC) — Convex-reactive, LOW risk
        │
Phase 82 (Files + Preview + Hardening)  Convex bounded-ingest bridge + e2e auth + OPS-01 + polish
```

**Critical path:** 80 → 81 → 82, strictly sequential (each builds on the prior surface). Phase 81's risk was retired by the locked SPEC.
**Cross-repo:** Forge-side counterparts land in the `forge` repo (emitter ✅ Phase 6; log sink `makeLogSink` finalization in Phase 81; command-poll daemon for Phase 80).

## v9.0 Readability & Experience — ACTIVE (started 2026-06-23)

**Milestone goal:** Make CodePulse readable and richer to operate — a readability-first, fully token-driven theme system with the "Midnight Aubergine" editorial skin, a durable Convex analytics rollup, the Agent Room completed into a real multi-persona surface, and an opt-in 3D render mode for the code/vault/KG graph.

**Phase summary:**

- [ ] **Phase 88 — Analytics Rollup** — Durable Convex 16 MiB read-limit fix via ingest-time rollups
- [ ] **Phase 89 — Readable Themes & Editorial Skin Toggle** — Token-driven theming + Midnight Aubergine skin + no-flash switcher + WCAG-AA pass
- [ ] **Phase 90 — Agent Room / War Room** — Wire live participant identity + bounded listing + real operator Join + transcript robustness
- [ ] **Phase 91 — 3D Memory Galaxy** — Opt-in `react-force-graph-3d` render mode on `CodeVaultGraph`, lazy-loaded, theme-aware

**Execution order:** 88 → 89 → 90 → 91 (88 is independent; 89 token cleanup gates 91's theme-aware node colors; 90 cross-repo audit recommended before 91 starts but can run in parallel with 91 if audit clears fast)

## Phase Details

### Phase 88: Analytics Rollup
**Goal**: Analytics queries read pre-aggregated rollup buckets instead of scanning raw event documents — eliminating the Convex 16 MiB/exec read-limit risk permanently.
**Depends on**: Nothing — Convex-only, no UI surface, lowest regression risk.
**Requirements**: AR-01, AR-02, AR-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every analytics query (`activityHeatmap`, `toolFlowSankey`, `errorRateTrend`, `tokenSunburst`, `tokenWaterfall`) reads well under 16 MiB at any event volume — no `.take()` count caps remain once rollups are authoritative.
  2. Rollup increments are idempotent: at-least-once ingest retries do not double-count; a one-time historical backfill action populates rollups for pre-existing events.
  3. Heatmap, sankey, and error-trend data fidelity is no longer bounded by the capped `.take()` limits restored after the quick-unblock (heatmap ≤1000, sankey ≤1000, errorRateTrend ≤300×3).
  4. Archival/retention sweeps in `dataRetention.ts` do not inflate or corrupt rollup counts (rollups remain consistent after events are archived or deleted).
**Plans**: 4 plans (4 waves)
  - [x] 88-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0: extract shared sankey classifier (convex/lib/sankeyClassify.ts) + scaffold 3 Nyquist test files (AR-01/02/03)
  - [x] 88-02-PLAN.md — Wave 1 (atomic deploy): idempotencyKey schema+index, in-mutation dedup + ingest-time event/sankey increments, remove computeHourly event/error branches, paginate cost cron, backfill action, httpAction key pass-through (AR-01, AR-02)
  - [x] 88-03-PLAN.md — Wave 2: run one-time historical backfill (operator checkpoint) + dataRetention aggregates-safety verify/test (AR-02)
  - [ ] 88-04-PLAN.md — Wave 3: rewrite heatmap/sankey/error-trend/sunburst to read aggregates, remove all .take() count caps, keep tokenWaterfall raw-bounded + render verify (AR-01, AR-03)

---

### Phase 89: Readable Themes & Editorial Skin Toggle
**Goal**: Operators can switch between a readable WCAG-AA theme, the Midnight Aubergine editorial skin, and Matrix Emerald — with zero flash on hard refresh and full token coverage across every surface including canvas-rendered graphs.
**Depends on**: Phase 71 design tokens (foundation exists; TH-01 token cleanup is the internal first step).
**Requirements**: TH-01, TH-02, TH-03, TH-04, TH-05, TH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The saved skin (Electric Cyan / Matrix Emerald / Midnight Aubergine) applies before first paint on hard refresh — no visible flash of unstyled or wrong-theme content (FOUC eliminated; blocking inline `<script>` in `index.html`; the two stale localStorage keys consolidated into one).
  2. `axe-core/playwright` reports zero WCAG-AA contrast violations on the five highest-traffic pages (Dashboard, Live Run, Analytics, Forge, Graphs) for every shipped theme.
  3. Canvas-rendered graphs (`ForceGraphCanvas`, `CodeVaultGraph`, KG Explorer) respect the active theme — no hardcoded `#06b6d4` cyan or `#10b981` emerald nodes remain; node colors read CSS custom properties via `useThemeColors()`.
  4. The Midnight Aubergine editorial skin renders with its full token set (warm aubergine background, cream text, gold/emerald/plum accents, paper-grain overlay) — distinct from and coexisting with the other two skins via `[data-theme="aubergine"]`.
  5. Scanline / matrix-grid / heavy glow animations are disabled for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled; the default skin remains Electric Cyan (readable theme is opt-in).
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

---

### Phase 90: Agent Room / War Room
**Goal**: The War Room surface shows real agent identity and gives the operator a genuine Join pathway — completing the ~70-75% built scaffolding into a usable, bounded, robust multi-persona room.
**Depends on**: Phase 88 (recommended — no hard dependency, but analytics stability reduces noise). Cross-repo: `astridr-repo` `POST /api/war-room` existence confirmed; participant-join surface must be audited before planning.
**Requirements**: ROOM-01, ROOM-02, ROOM-03, ROOM-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The War Room renders real participant identity — agent names, avatars, colors, and role badges sourced from `useRosterAgents()` data, not the four hardcoded placeholder props in `WarRoom.tsx`.
  2. Room listing is bounded (no unbounded `.collect()` on `warRooms`) and rooms are visibly populated from real Ástríðr→Convex ingest events (the `warRooms` ingest path confirmed live).
  3. The operator's "Join" button sends a real signal to Ástríðr (not cosmetic) — confirmed against the `astridr-repo` participant-join/voice surface; if real-time voice is unavailable in this phase, observer mode ships with an honest label.
  4. Each room has a stable deep-link URL (`/war-room/:roomId`) and transcript chunks render in deterministic order via a `seq` field (no out-of-order rendering under concurrent ingest).
**Plans**: TBD

---

### Phase 91: 3D Memory Galaxy
**Goal**: Operators can toggle an opt-in 3D render mode on `CodeVaultGraph` that renders the full ~4,038-node production graph at acceptable frame rates — without shipping three.js to users who stay in 2D mode.
**Depends on**: Phase 89 (TH-01 `useThemeColors()` resolver required for G3D-02 theme-aware node colors — hard dependency; 91 must come after 89 is complete).
**Requirements**: G3D-01, G3D-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The 3D toggle is visible on `CodeVaultGraph`; switching to 3D renders the graph using `react-force-graph-3d` and switching back to 2D restores `ForceGraphCanvas` — the 2D render path is unchanged and no regression exists on the default 2D view.
  2. The 2D bundle does not include three.js — `vite build` chunk manifest confirms `three` is isolated to its own lazy chunk; the 2D path loads zero three.js code.
  3. The 3D mode renders the ~4,038-node production graph at ≥30 FPS (validated against the live snapshot from the Convex `graphSnapshots` table before shipping).
  4. Toggling 2D↔3D disposes the WebGL context cleanly — no memory leak on repeated toggle (verified via DevTools memory snapshot or equivalent); the toggle state persists across page reloads via `idb-keyval`.
  5. 3D node colors respect the active theme — colors read from the Phase 89 `useThemeColors()` resolver, not hardcoded hex values.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

*Last updated: 2026-06-23 — v9.0 Readability & Experience roadmap defined (Phases 88-91). Execution order: 88 → 89 → 90 → 91. Phase 88 (AR-01..03) and Phase 89 (TH-01..06) already scaffolded. Phase 90 (ROOM-01..04) and Phase 91 (G3D-01..02) are new. Phase 89 TH-01 token cleanup gates Phase 91's theme-aware node colors (hard dependency). Phase 90 requires a cross-repo Ástríðr audit before planning (confirm `POST /api/war-room` ingest path + participant-join surface). Next: `/gsd-plan-phase 88`.*

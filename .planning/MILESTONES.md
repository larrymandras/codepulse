# Milestones

## v9.0 Readability & Experience (Shipped: 2026-06-29)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases (88–92), 30 plans, 43 tasks
**Timeline:** 2026-06-23 → 2026-06-29 (7 days) | 222 commits | 277 files, +33,655 / −3,495
**Requirements:** 19/19 (TH-01..06, AR-01..03, ROOM-01..04, G3D-01..02, VOX-01..04)
**Verification:** Phases 89/91/92 have VERIFICATION.md (91 verifier PASSED 10/10); Phase 90 operator live sign-off (`90-08-SUMMARY`); Phase 88 Nyquist VALIDATION (47/47 tests). All 5 phases have a VALIDATION.md. Phase 87/Phase 88 prod deploy `tidy-whale-981`.

**Key accomplishments:**

1. **AR — Durable Analytics Rollup (Phase 88):** Ingest-time rollups (`convex/analyticsRollup.ts` + shared `lib/sankeyClassify.ts`) maintained atomically from `ingest.ts`/`runtimeIngest.ts` — idempotency-keyed dedup (no double-count), a one-time historical backfill run against prod, and removal of every `.take()` count cap. Analytics queries now read O(buckets), permanently under Convex's 16 MiB/exec limit.
2. **TH — Readable Themes & Editorial Skin (Phase 89):** Fully token-driven theming (~77 hardcoded hex/rgba sites across ~24 files migrated to `var(--token)`, canvas graphs read tokens via `useThemeColors()`), a WCAG-AA readability-first theme, the Midnight Aubergine editorial skin, Matrix-Emerald + Electric Cyan retained, and a no-flash persisted switcher honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`. Zero axe violations across 4 themes × 5 surfaces (20 cases).
3. **ROOM — Agent / War Room finished (Phase 90):** Real participant identity from live roster (`useRosterAgents`), bounded room listing, genuine operator **Join** via LiveKit + the Ástríðr token endpoint, and per-room deep-links (`/war-room/:roomId`) with `seq`-ordered transcripts. Closed five live cross-repo integration gaps (LiveKit profile/workers, Convex deploy, `warRooms` ingest, transcript streaming, two CodePulse bugs) — operator live sign-off 2026-06-29.
4. **G3D — 3D Memory Galaxy (Phase 91):** Opt-in, lazy-loaded `react-force-graph-3d` render mode on `CodeVaultGraph` (three.js confined to the lazy chunk; 2D default never bundles it). Renders the ~4,038-node production graph at ≥30 FPS (operator GPU sign-off), disposes the WebGL context cleanly on 2D↔3D toggling, and colors nodes via the TH-01 `useThemeColors()` resolver.
5. **VOX — Voice Command Palette / Jarvis Mode (Phase 92):** Local in-browser openWakeWord ONNX wake-word detection (custom self-contained `hey_astrid.onnx`, no Picovoice/account), Web Speech STT via the shared `useSpeechRecognition` hook, streamed reply + persona TTS, and a safe-by-default OFF toggle that degrades gracefully on model-load failure (no silent hot mic).

**Notable:** Phases 90 and 91 were unbuilt at the 2026-06-26 milestone audit (`gaps_found`) and were completed 2026-06-27..29; the archived audit reflects that mid-flight snapshot, not the shipped state. VOX-01..04 were added to v9.0 after original scoping and back-filled into traceability 2026-06-26. The feared stale `milestones/v9.0-*` adversarial-track archives were verified absent from this repo (no rename needed).

**Known deferred items at close:** 8 (see STATE.md Deferred Items) — all non-blocking: 3 passed-UAT false positives (80/84/85), 2 verification flags still marked `human_needed` though signed off in docs (89/92), 1 stale unrelated quick task, 2 answered-but-unmarked CONTEXT question sets (078/89). Accepted tech debt: Phases 88 & 90 have no formal `VERIFICATION.md` (covered by Nyquist VALIDATION + operator live sign-off respectively).

## v8.0 Graph/KG Consolidation (Shipped: 2026-06-23)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases (83–87), 17 plans, 23 tasks
**Timeline:** 2026-06-18 → 2026-06-23 (6 days)
**Requirements:** 8/8 (GH-01..04, KG-08..11) — milestone audit PASSED
**Verification:** all phases verified; Phases 84/85/86/87 human-UAT'd via Playwright; Phase 87 deployed to prod (`tidy-whale-981`)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **GH-01 — Graph Snapshot Receiver:** Convex row-based tables (`graphSnapshots`/`graphSnapshotNodes`/`graphSnapshotLinks`) + versioned-swap upsert + retention cron + `case graph_snapshot` dispatch; stops dropping Ástríðr's nightly code/vault snapshots — the full ~4,038-node real graph is now live.
- **GH-02/GH-03 — Unified Graphs Hub:** replaced the `placeholder:true` nav stub with a real `/graphs` route + `GraphsHub`; `CodeVaultGraph` dual-palette render of the code+vault graph from Convex; Tool Galaxy / MCP Inventory / KG Explorer all reachable from one hub.
- **GH-04 — Cross-Graph Navigation:** `buildFocusUrl`/`useFocusParam` deep-links tool → owning agent → KG entity with same-origin `?from` return chips (normalized-EXACT matching, zero false jumps).
- **KG-09 — Community-Cluster Layout:** d3-force clustering + color halos in `ForceGraphCanvas`, auto-gated on the snapshot `community` field (no regression when absent).
- **KG-08 — Full-Text Search Lens:** `fetchSearch` + Search lens + `KGSearchResults` behind a graceful-degrade gate (live results data-gated on Ástríðr `/api/kg/search`, SEED-008).
- **KG-10/KG-11 — Saved Views + Temporal Diff/Animate:** `savedKgViews` + `useSavedViews` + `KGViewsPopover` + shareable `?view=<token>` links; `Point | Diff | Animate` temporal sub-modes (client-side `computeDiff` + `useKgAnimation` frame-synth + 20-entry LRU).

**Notable:** Phase 87 code review caught 1 BLOCKER (animation prefetch shared the frame display token → stuck frame) + 4 warnings, all fixed with a regression test. A pre-existing build break (stray `ThemeSwitcher` import without its committed component) was found + fixed during the close-out push; CI green.

## v5.0 Advanced Visualization & Integrations (Shipped: 2026-05-25)

**Phases completed:** 12 phases (6 with GSD plans, 6 built outside GSD), 23 plans, 31 tasks
**Files modified:** 668 | **Lines:** +76,219 / -3,401
**Timeline:** 10 days (2026-05-16 → 2026-05-25) | 267 commits

**Key accomplishments:**

1. **Schema foundation** — 4 new Convex tables (callGraphEdges, emailDeliveryLog, pagerdutyDeliveryLog, githubTriggerLog) and 2 table extensions (llmMetrics agentId/toolName, alertRuleCustom pagerdutyConfig/githubTrigger) unblocking all v5.0 features
2. **Multi-provider gateway** — Central provider registry (7 providers: 3 legacy + 4 gateway), OTel provider attribution fix, gateway event routing to dedicated tables, CLIGatewayTool telemetry emission
3. **Cost intelligence** — Provider billing registry with GPT/Gemini pricing, billingType-aware cost aggregation, SDK spend cap gauge with projected daily totals, subscription vs API-billed split views
4. **Gateway observability** — Real-time quota burndown gauges, routing decision audit table with score breakdown, provider comparison charts, per-provider cost trend stacking, gateway task lifecycle tracking
5. **SDK spend guard & multi-provider UX** — Provider enable/disable and priority controls with drag-to-reorder, session timeline provider badges, provider attribution across all surfaces
6. **External integrations & call graph** — Email digest delivery via Resend with daily cron, PagerDuty trigger/resolve via Events API v2 with stable dedup_key, agent/tool call graph visualization with dagre layout

## v4.0 CodePulse Operational Excellence (Shipped: 2026-04-14)

**Phases completed:** 8 phases, 36 plans
**Files modified:** 311 | **Lines:** +43,759 / -5,570
**Timeline:** 39 days (2026-03-06 → 2026-04-14)

**Key accomplishments:**

1. **Paperclip design language** — shadcn/ui New York, monochromatic oklch palette, zero border-radius, MetricCard/EntityRow patterns across 15 dashboard pages
2. **Bidirectional WebSocket telemetry** — real-time event push from Ástríðr, command sending, connection state management with auto-reconnect
3. **Command center UI** — Unified Inbox with keyboard navigation, Command Palette (Cmd+K), Agent Chat with Generative UI Blocks, Live Run Widget with Flow DAG, Insights Chat
4. **Task management** — 6-column Kanban with drag-and-drop, Ideation Findings with status workflow, Config Editor with inline diff/hot-reload, Cron management with visual builder
5. **Data pipeline** — Hourly/daily time-series aggregation, configurable retention with batch archival, cursor-based pagination across 7 list-view domains, Analytics page on pre-computed aggregates
6. **Alert routing** — Configurable rules (static + compound AND/OR), Discord/Slack webhook delivery with retry, acknowledge/mute/escalate lifecycle, per-severity notification preferences
7. **Intelligence layer** — Cost forecasting with moving averages, LLM-generated session briefings with daily digest cron, anomaly detection with z-score auto-alerts, memory quality metrics with dedup/staleness/contradiction detection
8. **Command catalog** — Live WebSocket-driven command registry on Capabilities page with accordion expand/collapse, category filter pills, dynamic search

**Known gaps:**

- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table was stale (checkboxes not updated during phase execution) — all phases verified complete via VERIFICATION.md reports
- INFRA-01 through INFRA-05 referenced in ROADMAP but undefined in REQUIREMENTS.md (Ástríðr-side requirements, out of CodePulse scope)
- UI-08 (Lucide icon standardization) not fully checked off — partial coverage across phases
